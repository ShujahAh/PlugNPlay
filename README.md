# PlugNPlay
Created by Ahmad Shujah

Summary:
PlugNPlay is a educational game tool that is designed to help elementary and middle school teachers easily create their own educational games
and lesson planes in order to distribute them to their students to play. It will have a huge selection of possible templates for the teacher to
incorporate whatever content they desire and in whatever order they desire. The application will allow those students to play the games that their
teacher created and is a fun and affective way to teach subject matters to students in elementary and middle schools. 

Notes:
There is a sample game called Bullying.txt that can be found in gameFiles.
Game can be played within an IDE, all files and graphics included.
A shawarma would be really nice right now.
